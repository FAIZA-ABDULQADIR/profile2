        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          As a passionate learner and aspiring UI/UX developer, my journey began when I realized the power of design to change the world.
          It started with my fascination with how people interact with technology. I wanted to make those interactions seamless and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I started my learning path by experimenting with different design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. I also began to dive deep into the principles of user-centered design, focusing on accessibility, usability, and aesthetic value. I realized that a good user interface is not just about making things look good; it's about creating a smooth and intuitive experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Through various projects, I learned the importance of combining both aesthetics and functionality. I worked on redesigning websites and creating mockups for mobile applications. One of my most exciting projects involved creating an intuitive onboarding experience for a local startup's mobile app, which significantly improved user engagement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m driven by the idea of creating designs that not only look good but also enhance the user's interaction with technology. I aim to combine my creativity with technical skills to build products that users love to engage with.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
